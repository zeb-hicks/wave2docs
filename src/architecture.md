### Architecture

The Wave2 CPU has 8 constant and 8* general purpose registers.

Wave2's architecture is designed such that most operations are [SIMD](/arch/simd.md), affecting all four words of their respective [vectors](/vectors.md).

In addition, it is a multi-user simulation. Each user has multiple cores, and all users and their cores are executed concurrently.

The bytes in [memory](/memory.md) are stored in little-endian order. Bytes from user writes, such as from chat or when loading binaries, are interpreted as big-endian, and then written to memory in little-endian.

The vector words are also in little-endian order, such that the least significant component `X` is the first in memory. The memory order begins at the least significant byte, with the least significant word first.

All CPU registers are [SIMD vectors](/arch/simd.md), holding a quartet of 16-bit words.<br>Some special instructions can operate on vectors as an octuplet of 8-bit words.

Memory is addressed by 16-bit words. Each memory address maps to a single word within its vector.

For example:
```
0x0000 => 0xABCD
0x0001 => 0xEF39
```

See [Memory](/memory.md) for more on the memory and its layout.
