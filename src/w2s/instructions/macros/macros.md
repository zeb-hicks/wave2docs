# Macros

The assembler has some useful macros that make writing programs more ergonomic by abstracting away things like conditional jumps or inline literals.

The following macros are currently supported:

- [Jump](./jump.md) - Write to the program counter ergonomically
- [Set](./set.md) - Assign labels or literals directly to registers
- [Labels](./labels.md) - Store named positions within the program
